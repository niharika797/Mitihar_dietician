Cover with a lid and steam until the top gets cooked.Once the top is steamed, open the lid and flip the paniyam and cook on the other side until golden and lightly crisp.Â Transfer the paniyaram to a serving bow and serve it along with chutney for a hearty breakfast or even a snack.And this chutney is super simple to make - fresh grated coconut, along with a handful of almonds, a couple of green chillies, an inch piece ginger, salt and lemon.

The batter will look fluffy.Grind the rice and millet mixture into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into an almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery.Â Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.*Note on fermenting the Ragi Idli & Dosa BatterFermenting has to take place where the weather is warm. So ideally in summer, the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity.But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven. If your oven has a light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven.Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment. If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment.

Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 6 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place a portion of the tofu methi paratha filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around.

Continue pressing the dough until the rotla has attained a round shape. If you find any cracks, use your finger to pinch the cracks together and seal them.

Ingredients for paneer paratha stuffing

							 		1 cup Paneer (Homemade Cottage Cheese)							 		, crumbled							 	

							 		1 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera)							 		, roasted and ground							 	

							 		2 Green Chillies							 		, finely chopped							 	

							 		1 Onion							 		, finely chopped							 	

							 		1 cup Cabbage (Patta Gobi/ Muttaikose)							 		, finely chopped							 	

							 		2 sprig Coriander (Dhania) Leaves							 		, finely chopped							 	

Salt							 		, to taste							 	
","To begin making the Paneer Paratha Recipe, we will first need to make the dough for the parathas. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 14 to 16 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the filling is ready.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. I am going to be using homemade paneer as it makes the parathas softer, but you can use store bought paneer as well.In a large bowl; add in the homemade paneer. Use your fingers or a fork and begin to crumble the cottage cheese.Â Next add in 1 large chopped onion, finely chopped cabbage, lots of chopped coriander, the more you add the more flavor you get. Then add in the finely chopped green chillies, a large teaspoon of cumin powder, and finally some salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 10 to 12 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around.Â Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha. Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a paneer paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow the parathas to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the paneer paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side cooks on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the paneer parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the paneer paratha is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way.Serve the Stuffed Paneer Paratha Recipe along with aÂ RaitaÂ andÂ Strawberry Chutney. You can pack them for your kids lunch box or take them as a travel snack. It is filling and nutritious.Â ",181,38.5992,7.4656,15.3061

Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges.

The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosaâs the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosaâs away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other.
