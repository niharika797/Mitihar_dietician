","To begin making the Mysore Masala Dosa Recipe, we will first make the Ragi (Millet) Idli Dosa Batter.Add idli rice and ragi in a big bowl together, the level of water required is an inch above the rice in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. The level of water will be 2 inches above the dal in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy.Grind the rice and millet mixture into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into an almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery.Â Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.*Note on fermenting the Ragi Idli & Dosa BatterFermenting has to take place where the weather is warm. So ideally in summer, the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity.But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven. If your oven has a light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven.Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment. If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment. This process can be mastered with experience.*To Make the Red ChutneySoak the dry red chilli in warm water for at least 20 minutes.Once done you can add all the ingredients - Onion, ginger, garlic, roasted gram dal, soaked dry red chillies and salt into a mixer and grind with little water to form a coarse paste.You can check for seasoning and adjust the salt or spice level if you want later on and set aside in a bowl.*To make the PalyaPressure cook the potatoes with 2 cups of water, sprinkle little salt and cook for atleast 4 whistle.Once done allow the pressure cooker to release naturally, and drain all the water and peel off the skin and mash the potatoes and set aside.Heat a flat skillet with oil, add mustard seeds and allow it to sizzle for few seconds.

Ingredients for dough

							 		2 cups Whole Wheat Flour 

							 		1/2 teaspoon Salt 

							 		1 teaspoon Oil 
Ingredients for paneer paratha stuffing

							 		2 sprig Coriander (Dhania) Leaves							 		, finely chopped							 	

Salt							 		, to taste							 	
","To begin making the Paneer Paratha Recipe, we will first need to make the dough for the parathas. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 14 to 16 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the filling is ready.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. I am going to be using homemade paneer as it makes the parathas softer, but you can use store bought paneer as well.In a large bowl; add in the homemade paneer. Use your fingers or a fork and begin to crumble the cottage cheese.Â Next add in 1 large chopped onion, finely chopped cabbage, lots of chopped coriander, the more you add the more flavor you get. Then add in the finely chopped green chillies, a large teaspoon of cumin powder, and finally some salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 10 to 12 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around.Â Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha. Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a paneer paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow the parathas to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the paneer paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side cooks on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the paneer parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the paneer paratha is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way.Serve the Stuffed Paneer Paratha Recipe along with aÂ RaitaÂ andÂ Strawberry Chutney. You can pack them for your kids lunch box or take them as a travel snack. It is filling and nutritious.Â ",181,38.5992,7.4656,15.3061

This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around.Â Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha. Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a paneer methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the paneer paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the paneer parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the paneer paratha is cooked transfer to a plate.

Add one tablespoon of oil to coat the dough and knead again. Cover and set aside for 15 minutes.Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions. Preheat the iron skillet on medium heat.Roll the dough portions into balls and flatten them with the palm of your hand. Toss them in flour and roll them out into circles of approximately 3 inches in diameter. Drizzle a little ghee and spread it on the rolled dough.We need to get a triangle shape, to do so, first fold into a semi-circle, then fold the semi-circle into half again. You get a mini triangle shape. Tossing the triangle in a little flour, roll it out gently into a big triangle. Continue the same process of rolling with the remaining dough portions.With skillet on medium high heat, place one rolled out palak paratha on the skillet. After a few seconds, you will notice air pockets popping out. At this point flip the palak paratha and smear about 1/2 a teaspoon of ghee. Using a flat spatula do a light pressing and turning motion to cook to the paratha.Flip to the other side and press and turn the paratha in a similar way. You will notice brown spots around the parathas and it will be slightly crisp. Remove from heat and place on a platter or serve hot.Continue the similar process with the remaining rolled portions and stack the cooked paratha one above the other and serve hot.",731,114.8558,37.1352,80.2998

","To begin making the Aloo Paratha Recipe, first we will make the paratha dough. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour. Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough. Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead little more. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the it to rest until you get the filling ready.The next step is to make the filling for the aloo parathas.Mash the potatoes into a coarse lumpy texture with your fingers or a fork.Once mashed, add in the green chillies, onions, coriander leaves, salt to taste, cumin powder, coriander powder, dry mango powder, garam masala, turmeric powder and finally if you want it extra spicy, the red chilli powder. Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients into the potatoes until well combined.Divide the aloo paratha filling into 8 to 10 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of aloo paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.The final step is to stuff the filling into the aloo paratha dough.Dust the paratha dough in dry wheat flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter circle.Take a portion of filling and place it in the center. Next gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together. Remove the little excess dough which pops out when you bring the edges together. Press the filled aloo paratha dough down.Dust the filled aloo paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying very little pressure. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.Preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled aloo paratha. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the aloo parathas to get a crisp on the outside.Once the aloo paratha is cooked transfer to a plate and serve hot.Serve theÂ Aloo ParathaÂ along withÂ Aam Ka Achaar RecipeÂ orÂ Â homemade curdÂ orÂ Masala ChaasÂ for your Breakfast.",815,185.5687,22.808,24.353

This dosa unlike other dosa batter, the neer dosa is made purely from rice and combined along with coconut. The coconut not only gives the batter a good taste, but also gives it a soft texture. If you have never made Rava Dosa or Neer Dosa before, then this dosa will take a little practice to get the desired consistency of the batter and the texture.Â ",Mangalorean,South Indian Breakfast,Vegetarian,"

","To begin making the Mangalorean Neer Dosa Recipe; we will first soak the rice in completely immersed in water for at least 3 hours.Once the rice is soaked well, drain out the water. Grind the soaked rice, coconut and salt in a blender adding water little at a time to make a smooth batter. It is important to add a little water at a time to grind the rice into a smooth batter. When you feel the batter between your fingers it should be smooth and not coarse.Once the Neer Dosa batter is ground, transfer it to a large bowl. Add enough water such that the dosa batter has a smooth flowing consistency. The consistency of the batter should be such that the batter has a very thin coating at the back of the spoon and not a thick coating. If if forms a thick later, then the you need to add a little more water.Â Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.The Neer Dosa batter is now ready to be made. The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Neer Dosa, we donât spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked and has a rich white colour. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosaâs the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosaâs away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Mangalorean Neer Dosa Recipe along withÂ ManoliÂ CurryÂ orÂ Egg CurryÂ for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.",1404,309.27,25.779,0

","To begin making Dahi Sabudana, first dry roast the sabudana in a heavy bottom pan for 8-10 minutes or till it just starts to pop (You can see that each grain will increase in size).Cool and add it with the curd-water mixture in a mixing bowl.Cover and keep aside for about 2 hours until the sabudana grains soften.After 2 to 2 Â½ hours, check the consistency of the sabudana (tapioca pearls) and add more yogurt/curd/water if required.Add groundnut powder, sugar, salt and mix.In a small wok/pan, heat ghee; add the cumin seeds and green chillies and allow them to crackle.Turn off the heat and pour this tadka over the Dahi Sabudana.Serve Dahi Sabudana for breakfast option on regular day or on fasting days. You can also serve Dahi Sabudana on its own or along with a sweet lime pickle.",4654,35.311,63.791,12.41
